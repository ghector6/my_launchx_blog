Wow, Learning JavaScript hasn´t being easy at all, I´ve being trying to read every book that cross my sight but it´s too much.
I wish I lived on "The Matrix" and just plug a cable through my neck and learn the whole possibilities that JS can bring to me.
I still don´t get what an object is neither a function, but hey, baby steps, right?
Learning About the FrameWorks, the POO part just installs more doubts into my brain. 

A book that has being helping me through this journy is "A smart way to learn JavaScript", but wow, as I said before it´s too much!
Declaring variables, learning the scoop, the syntaxis, the If statements, Loops, Operators, Arrays, Functions and a HUUUGE etc...

 
At this date I´m at page 100... it´s actually a good achievement for me, I´ve been doing like... 3 to 4 exercises from the book daily.
Sometimes my brain feels dizzy and numb but I keep on. I guess that´s a good path. 
Today my Mission Commander told us about another JavaScript book. Definetely gonna check it.
